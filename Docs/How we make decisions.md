At the start of any project or initiative, it is very important that the team agrees on a set of values and principles that guide their decision making ahead. 

This can be seen as a sort of constitution for all projects that PositiveSumProjects undertakes. 

Here they go, in no particular order:

1. **The customer comes first.**
	- Our role in the world is to be of service to others. 
	- All steps taken must empathize and think about the end user first, and lead from there. 
	- Any metrics that indicate growth or progress must be linked both subjectively and objectively to the end user.

2. **K.I.S.S - Keep it Simple, Stupid**
	- If you can't explain something simply, you probably don't understand it well enough. 
	- All communication, decisions, features and execution must be simple. 

3. **Challenge the norm through first principles**
	- We must understand things deeply and push ourselves to challenge the norm regularly. 
	- At no point should there be answers to questions that sound like "This is like this because it's always been like this."

4. **Build on abundant financial fundamentals**
	- This is a personal opinion (naman) that if you're smart enough, you can figure to generate enough disproportionate value for the world, that it gives you financial abundance. 
	- While the funding, loan and other routes of building a business exist and work, PSP (positivesumprojects) would like to build and maintain financial abundance from day 1.
	- In practice, this means:
		- Keep a track of both spend and time from day 1. *Even if we fund initiatives through our own pockets.* 
		- Put stop-losses on initiatives. 
		- Build business models that fund us from day 1. *This doesn't mean that the core value prop needs to do the funding, but that the entire business (as an allocation of our time) should create real world monetizable value from day 1.*
	- This leads to a variety of constraints that actually empower us:
		- This will force us to be smart. 
		- This will force us to do only the things that are really valuable to the end user. 
		- This will force us to prioritize the things that matter.
		- This will force us to value our time.

5. **Have fun!**
	- Don't ask what the world needs, ask what makes you come alive. Because what the world needs most, is more people who come alive. 
	- We must focus on having fun, fun in the service of our customers, fun in the process, fun with no expectation of any outcome. 
	- Should this stop being fun, we must pause, reflect and question ourselves. And do everything it takes to move towards both individual and collective fun. Even if that might mean letting go of certain things. 
	- Having fun is the only way of building something that lasts long enough to bring any compounding returns, both for you and the end user.
